*  This is a component driver of the QolSys IQ Alarm Panel Virtual Alarm
*  Panel Driver.  Devices using this driver are automatically created as needed.

*   Change Log:
*   2021-12-03: Initial version
*
*   Notes:
*   ======
*   This driver represents a "takeover module", also called a "hardwire translator".  This device
*   adds hardwired zones to the IQ2 panel, allowing things like hard-wired smoke and CO detectors
*   and existing alarm sensors from an older non-wireless panel (hence the name "takeover module").
*
*   This driver supports the PG9WLSHW8 PowerG expansion module, and no doubt other modules as well
*   that identify themselves as a takeover module.  While the IQ2 panel reports open/closed status
*   for the PG9WLSHW8, it is not clear exactly what "open" and "closed" represents.
